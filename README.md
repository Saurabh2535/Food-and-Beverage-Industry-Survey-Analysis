# Food-and-Beverage-Industry-Survey-Analysis
This document outlines the detailed steps followed during the analysis of the Food and Beverage Industry Survey data. It includes data collection, cleaning, analysis, and the final creation of interactive dashboards using Power BI.

**1.Data Collection**

The data was collected from a survey conducted across 10 major cities in India, with a total of 10,000 respondents. The survey captured various aspects of consumer behavior including:

1.Frequency of consumption

2.Brand perception

3.Taste experience

4.Health concerns

5.Packaging preferences

6.Marketing channels used

**2. Data Preparation**

Before analysis, the raw data required cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and usability.

**Steps Followed:**

**Data Import:** Imported the raw survey data into Power BI Desktop.
**Handling Missing Values:** Checked for missing values and either removed or replaced them with appropriate averages/medians (based on the context).
**Outlier Detection:** Identified and handled outliers that could skew the analysis.
**Normalization:** Standardized categorical variables such as cities, age groups, and gender for consistency.
**Data Transformation:** Transformed columns where necessary (e.g., converting time-related data into a consistent format).

**3. Data Analysis**

Once the data was clean, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and correlations.

**Key Steps:**

**Demographic Breakdown:** Analyzed age, gender, and city distributions to understand the respondent profile.

**Consumption Patterns:** Investigated how frequently consumers used food and beverage products.

**Brand Perception and Experience:** Examined how consumers rated different brands in terms of taste and overall experience.

**Health Concerns:** Analyzed the data on health concerns related to specific brands.

**Packaging Preferences:** Explored preferences for packaging types (compact cans, innovative designs, etc.).

**4. Power BI Dashboard Creation**

Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data dynamically.

**Steps in Dashboard Creation:**

**Data Import into Power BI:** Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI.

**KPI Calculations:** Created key performance indicators (KPIs) for the following:

**1.Total Responses**

**2.Average Taste Experience**

**3.Current Brand Preference**

**4.Price Sensitivity**

**DAX Formulas:** Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate custom measures, such as health concern percentages and brand reputation scores.
**Slicers Implementation:** Added interactive slicers for age, city, and gender to allow users to filter the data and drill down into specific demographics.
**Visualizations:**

**Pie Charts:** For showing demographic breakdowns and packaging preferences.

**Bar Charts:** For comparison between different consumption frequencies and pricing preferences.

**Gauge Charts:** To represent the average taste experience.

**Matrix Tables:** To cross-analyze brands, marketing channels, and product improvements.

**5. Key Insights Identified**

Based on the analysis and visualizations, I derived several actionable insights:

**Younger consumers** (aged 19-30) accounted for **55.2%** of total responses, making them the most engaged group.

**50%** of respondents showed a preference for **natural/organic ingredients**, while **39%** expressed a preference for **compact and portable packaging.**

**42.88%** of respondents preferred products in the price range of **₹50-₹99**, showing clear price sensitivity.

Health concerns were significant, with **60%+** of respondents expressing concerns regarding popular brands like Cola Coka and Bepsi.

**6. Conclusion and Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, I provided the following recommendations:

Focus on **natural ingredients** and **eco-friendly packaging** to appeal to the growing demand for health-conscious products.
**Target younger consumers** with digital marketing strategies, as they represent the largest consumer base in the dataset.
Consider product offerings in the mid-range pricing (₹50-₹99) to cater to the largest group of price-sensitive customers.

**7. Final Deliverables**

**Power BI Dashboard:** Interactive, dynamic dashboards that provide insights into consumer preferences and brand perception.

**Presentation of Insights:** A detailed analysis highlighting key trends and actionable recommendations for businesses in the **Food and Beverage Industry.**
